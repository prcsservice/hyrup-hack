        title: "Writing a Problem Statement",
        description: "A great problem statement clearly identifies the gap between the current reality and the desired future. It should be specific, measurable, and focused on the user's pain point, not the lack of your solution.",
        goodExample: "Small-scale farmers in Maharashtra lose 30% of their onion harvest due to lack of affordable, humidity-controlled storage facilities, leading to an annual income loss of ₹45,000 per family.",
        badExample: "Farmers are losing money because there is no app to track their storage.",
        tips: [
            "Focus on the 'Why' and 'Who', not the 'How'.",
            "Use data or specific scenarios if possible.",
            "Avoid mentioning your solution in the problem statement.",
            "Keep it under 3 sentences."
        ]
    },
    evidence: {
        title: "Providing Evidence",
        description: "Back up your problem statement with facts. Judges look for proof that this is a real, urgent problem worth solving. This is not about your opinion, but about objective reality.",
        goodExample: "According to the 2023 Agricultural Ministry Report, post-harvest losses account for ₹92,000 crore annually in India. A survey of 50 local farmers in Nashik confirmed that 85% rely on traditional bamboo structures which offer no humidity control.",
        badExample: "I have seen many farmers suffering. It is a very big problem in India.",
        tips: [
            "Cite reputable sources (Govt reports, verified news).",
            "Include primary research if you have it (interviews, surveys).",
            "Be specific with numbers (percentages, currency).",
            "Recent data (last 2-3 years) is stronger."
        ]
    },
    solution: {
        title: "Describing Your Solution",
        description: "Explain HOW you solve the problem. Focus on the mechanism and the user experience. Don't just list features; explain how the solution directly addresses the root cause identified in the problem statement.",
        goodExample: "We propose a solar-powered, modular dehydration unit that costs less than ₹15,000. It uses IoT sensors to auto-regulate temperature, preserving onion shelf-life for up to 6 months. Farmers can rent these units on a pay-per-use basis.",
        badExample: "We will build an AI-based app that tells farmers what to do.",
        tips: [
            "Explain the mechanism (How does it work?).",
            "Hardware/Software integration (if applicable).",
            "Mention feasibility/affordability.",
            "Avoid buzzwords like 'AI' unless you explain how it's used."

    domain: {
        title: "Project Domain",
        description: "Select the primary category that your problem falls under. This helps assign the right judges to your project. If it spans multiple, pick the most dominant one.",
        goodExample: "Healthcare (for a hospital management system) or Climate (for a waste reduction app).",
        badExample: "Selecting 'Other' when a clear category exists.",
        tips: [
            "Think about the *problem* source, not just the solution.",
            "Accessibility projects often overlap with Healthcare or Education.",
            "Smart City projects often involve Energy, Mobility, or Safety.",
            "Civic Tech is for governance and citizen engagement."

    impact: {
        title: "Projected Impact",
        description: "What happens if your solution succeeds? improved lives, saved money, or environmental benefits.",
        goodExample: "By reducing waste by 50%, we can increase average farmer income by ₹20,000 per season. If scaled to one district, this saves 500 tons of produce annually.",
        badExample: "Everyone will be happy and rich.",
        tips: [
            "Quantify if possible (money saved, lives impacted).",
            "Think about second-order effects (environmental, social).",
            "Be optimistic but grounded.",
            "Differentiate between immediate output and long-term outcome."

    targetAudience: {
        title: "Target Audience",
        description: "Who exactly are you solving for? Be specific about demographics, geography, or behavior. 'Everyone' is not a target audience.",
        goodExample: "Small-scale cotton farmers in Gujarat who own less than 2 acres of land and suffer from irregular water supply.",
        badExample: "All farmers in India.",
        tips: [
            "Be specific (Location, Age, Profession).",
            "Focus on the early adopters first.",
            "Understand their constraints (tech literacy, budget).",
            "Why will they use YOUR solution?"
